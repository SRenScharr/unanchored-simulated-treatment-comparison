Firstly run Run.R to get the estimated treatment effects and then run Results.R to evaluate the estimated treatment effects.

1. All_functions: the functions needed in estimation
2. Model_input_S1_BB.csv: model input for the simulations
3. Output_functions: functions used to calculate bias, model SE, empirical SE, coverage
4. Results.R: R code to evaluate model results using bisa, model SE, empirical SE, coverage
5. Run.R: run the simulations with results saved in Output folder (mean in first column and SD in second column)
6. True correlation.R: calculate the Pearson correlation of binary varaibles simulated using the NORTA algorithm
7. True_trt_cal.R: calculate the true treament effect numerically, saved in Results folder
