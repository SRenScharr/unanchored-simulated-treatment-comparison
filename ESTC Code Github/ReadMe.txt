Firstly run Run.R to get the estimated treatment effects and then run Results.R to evaluate the estimated treatment effects.

1. All_functions: the functions needed in estimation
2. model_input_S1_BB.csv: model input for the simulations
3. Output_functions: functions used to calculate bias, SE, coverage
4. Results.R: R code to evaluate model results using bisa, SE, coverage
5. Run.R: run the simulations with results (mean in first column and SD in second column), saved in Output folder
6. True correlation.R: calculate the Pearson correlation of binary varaibles simulated using Copula
7. true_trt_cal.R: calculate the true treament effect, saved in Results folder
